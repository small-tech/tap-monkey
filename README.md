Progress of tests being run is shown by a single-line animation of the emoji monkey heads alternating between see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil poses as the titles of test collections being run and passing tests are shown alongside. At the end, an emoji banana is shown next to ‚ÄúAll tests passing. Total: 163. Passing 163. Failing 0. Duration 14.19 secs.](https://small-tech.org/images/tap-monkey.gif)

A [tap](https://testanything.org/) formatter that‚Äôs also a monkey.

Displays test runner status using a static single-line spinner (hint: it‚Äôs a monkey) and only fills your screen with text on failures and with your coverage report.

Use it like [tap-spec](https://github.com/scottcorgan/tap-spec) for running regular tests and also like [tap-nyc](https://github.com/MegaArman/tap-nyc) for running coverage with [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) or [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc).

## Install

```sh
npm i @small-tech/tap-monkey
```

## Use

Pipe your tap test output to tap-monkey (e.g., if your _test.js_ file contains [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) tests):

```sh
node test.js | npx tap-monkey
```

Or, as a test task in your _package.json_ file:

```json
"scripts" : {
  "test": "node test.js | tap-monkey"
}
```

Or, if you have more than one test file:

```json
"scripts" : {
  "test": "tape test/**/*js | tap-monkey"
}
```

Or, if you want to run code coverage (e.g., using [c8]()):

```json
"scripts" : {
  "test": "c8 tape test/**/*js | tap-monkey"
}
```
